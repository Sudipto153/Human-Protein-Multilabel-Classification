# Human-Protein-Multilabel-Classification
The model was built on top of the 'Resnext50_32x4d' network architecture using transfer learning. It can detect ten types of human protein structures in a given picture. The train and test dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jovian-pytorch-z2g/data. The accuracy of the model was calculated by F-scores. It achieved a validation accuracy of 80.39% and when submitted for the test score in the 'kaggle competition', it achieved a test accuracy of 78.787% (public score) and 77.8% (private score).

While training, at first the pretrained weights of the architecture were freezed so that only the added layers could be trained. After ten epochs, when a reasonable accuracy was achieved, then all the weights were unfreezed and trained together but with a smaller learning rate. For learning rate scheduling, OneCycleLR seemed to work better. The model can detect and classify multiple protein structures in a single cell. Therefore, F-scores was used with a threshold of 0.5 to predict the accuracy of the model. A sigmoid function was also used at the end of the network instead of softmax so that in a single prediction of image, each class could produce independent probabilities. The classes with probabilities greater than the threshold were declared to be present in the image.
